# respawnglitchfix/instantrespawn2
a simple solution to the respawn glitch in GeyserMC

- this is made from the InstantRespawn plugin by compgeek28, its very old and outdated so the point of this is to fix all the problems like how you can't pick up items after respawning. (this plugin was commonly used to fix the ever well known geyser respawn issues)

- don't forget to configure the permissions, they can be found in the config.

- check out the original plugin here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/instant-respawn.2884/

- can be used as a complete replacement for the InstantRespawn plugin!

- report any problems to me in telegram (infinitehertz) or email and I will try my best to make time and fix it

if you are looking for another fix to the problem and this solution has not worked for you, try removing the viaversion plugin (there was some sort of conflict but I never went into the details)
