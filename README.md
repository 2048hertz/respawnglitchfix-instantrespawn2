# respawnglitchfix
a simple solution to the respawn glitch in GeyserMC

This is made from the InstantRespawn plugin by compgeek28, its very old and outdated so the point of this is to fix all the problems like can't pick up items after death 
and make a new plugin.

Check out the original plugin: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/instant-respawn.2884/

Can be used as a replacement for the InstantRespawn plugin!
